This pan of tastiness is kick ass to have on hand for those days when you just don't have time or feel like cooking breakfast. My wife and I make this on Sunday and eat several days of the following week.

Oh, it's totally keto too. <br/>
<br/>
## What you need
* A hand blender (if available - it's the best tool for the job)
* A tall, skinny 2qt container, or large bowl. 
* an 8 x 8 inch, or 9 x 13 inch baking dish. Glass/Pyrex is perferred.
* Eggs. I use 10 large eggs for a 9 X 13, or 6 for an 8 X 8. 
* An equal amount of dairy - by weight.
  * I figure large eggs weigh about 50g each, so 10 eggs will need ~ 500g of dairy. 6 will be 300g of dairy. etc.
  * Heavy cream works great, as does cottage cheese. 1/2 and 1/2 blend is very nice.
* 2c of shredded cheese - chef's choice.
  * Stronger cheeses hold up well - gruyere, sharp cheddar, jack
* Some fillings. Take your pick from the list or come up with your own. Release your inner Guy Fieri and get your ass to flavortown
    * Meat: breakfast sausage? Ham? Hot italian sausage? How about meatballs? Figure 1lb for 9x13, 8oz for 8x8. 
    * Aromatics: A diced onion is a must. Diced peppers also work great. 
    * Add-ons: Sliced mushrooms? How about a handful of spinach or kale? Thin chop if you do.
* Seasoning - salt, pepper, maybe a pinch of nutmeg if you're feeling particularly french.

## Do this
* Set your oven to 350ºF
* grease up your baking dish
* Chop your aromatics & optional mushrooms / spinach / kale. Shred or dice ham if using.
* Brown up your sausage in a large skillet on medium high heat (if you're not doing ham) - remove to a bowl when cooked
* Drop in the aromatics & optional mushrooms. Sautée until translucent.
* toss in leafy greens & cooked sausage/ham - cook until greans are wilted.
* Transfer this filling evenly across the bottom of the baking dish. 
* Sprinkle cheese evenly over top of that tasty filling.
* Crack your eggs into a small bowl, then transfer to the mixing container when you're sure you didn't get shells in them.
* Place mixing bowl on kitchen scale set to grams, and tare (reset to zero) when settled.
* Pour / scoup in your dairy - equal to number of eggs X 50g. 
* Add a healthy pinch of salt, plus the nutmeg if you're taking the option (a little nutmeg goes a long way).
* Blend the bejeezus out of it with the hand blender. Wait for the mix to go very slack / loosen up, plus 10 to 15 seconds longer (count it - it feels like forever). This is important for the final texture of the dish.
* pour egg mix (the Royale) over a spatula on to the fillings / cheese. By pouring over a spat, you won't disturb that wonderful even distribution of the cheese.
* Grind up some pepper on top if you want.
* Bake for 30 minutes. Open oven and gently shake baking dish. If it jiggles, give it another 5 minutes. If it doesn't jiggle, it's done.
